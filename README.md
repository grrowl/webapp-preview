# iPhone App Preview

This is just a small tiny code to load your webapp in iFrame with background and size of iPhone. I created this for my personal use to show someone how the progress of web-app is going on and to get idea about how it looks in iPhone.

Hope this tiny code helps others.

Forked from [@geekrax](https://github.com/geekrax/webapp-preview). This fork adds a global `App` object which maps to the iFrame's `window`, and centers within the window a little nicer.
